# phonimod
It was a fun project I was working on when I was in my sophmore in undergrad. 
It basically converts the raw audio data to be represented as a noise image.

I added a couple of features like trimming audio, waveform representation, etc.

The whole point of the project was to learning advanced indexing in Matlab.
Also this was my first GUI programming experience!
